    ">For this project, I am assuming a hypothetical scenario of a concept Indian entrepreneur who wants to explore opening a reliable South Indian restaurant in Toronto, Canada. The idea behind this project is that there may not be enough Indian restaurants in Toronto and it might present a great opportunity for this entrepreneur who is based in Toronto. The entrepreneur wants to open the restaurant near other Indian restaurants because people who like Indian food may tend to like south Indian food. Finding the location to open the restaurant is the most important and crucial decision for the entrepreneur and this project is all about helping him find the optimal location."
